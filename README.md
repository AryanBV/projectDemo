# Time Complexity:
    The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of s2, because we only loop through s2 once and compare the frequency arrays in constant time (26 elements).

# Space Complexity:
    The space complexity is O(1) since we are using fixed-size arrays (26 elements for the alphabet).
